Paper 1: Cloud Security 
Title : Modern Encryption to Enhance Confidentiality in Cloud  Computing 

Virtualization empowers Cloud computing to give hardware and programming administrations to the clients on interest. The secrecy of cloud information is broken, and then it will result in loss of information to the business. Security of cloud storage is guaranteed through secrecy parameter which means confidentiality. To guarantee this secrecy, the most well-known utilized technique is encryption. 

This paper proposes a strategy or a framework for cloud storage system in light of fingerprint authorization, furthermore with blended encryption to secure a safe correspondence, enhance the productivity of cloud storage character confirmation and information transmission, security and dependability, and the verification system effectiveness and execution of the prerequisites, and be successfully utilized as a part of cloud storage framework.   

Paper 2: CLoud Testing
Title: Framework for Assessing Resources Scheduling and Management in Cloud Testing Platform 
Abstract:
Due to the inherent advantages of Cloud Computing paradigms, application development, deployment and usage in cloud environments has been increased exponentially in the recent preceding. Developing and testing are two key steps of software engineering and are closely parallel with each other. With the continuous increase of software scale and complexity, the developing and testing model and technologies are changing and evolving accordingly. 

developing a C-Meter into a complete resource management framework for computing clouds, and some problems on job control, job monitoring, and Fault Tolerance.
